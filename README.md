Hi eveyone, Here I have attached 3 files.
Firstly you need to download those file and kept together in a same folder.
Open #that folder via your python IDE.
then Run the mycalc.py file alone.
Finally a simple calculator will be there !!!!!

Note : Kindly use the numbers keypad on the calculator and not to give numbers from your laptop keyboard/PC keyboard.
